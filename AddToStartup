Steps to add this program to the startup, i.e. 
an Ad-hoc network gets created/joined at startup, no more fuss.

1. On the terminal type:  
sudo su
gedit /etc/init.d/onBoot
/* on the gedit window type and save 
        #!/bin/sh
        /path/to/onBoot.sh
   for example,on my computer it looks like:
        #!/bin/sh
        /home/spandan/Desktop/SwarmFiles/AdhocNetwork/onBoot.sh
    Press ctrl+x and save.
*/
chmod ugo+x /etc/init.d/onBoot
update-rc.d onBoot defaults

2. On the directory where you're reading this, donot forget to 
    give executable access to onBoot.sh
    You can do this by:  chmod +rwxrwxrwx onBoot.sh
    (You'd have done this already when you had typed chmod +rwxrwxrwx * )
