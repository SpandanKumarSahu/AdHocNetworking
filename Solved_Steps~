Step-1: NETWORK SCAN AND WRITE IT TO A FILE
            iwlist wlan0 scan > /home/spandan/desktop/NetworkScan.txt
Step-2: CHECK IF REQUIRED CONNECTION IS OPEN
            Open in either C++ or Python and search for SSID or ESSID.
Step-3(a): CONNECT TO NETWORK
            nmcli c up id <NetworkName> > somefile.txt
            example: ncmli c up id CAMPUS
STEP-3(b): CREATE A NEW NETWORK
            // This is a work-away till I get a permanent solution
            1. Initially create a ad-hoc network from the gui on all devices.
            2. Then use nmcli con up id <ESSID_of_connection>
